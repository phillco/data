Additionally, numerous opportunities exist for students to participate  in original scientific research projects.  Students with specific  educational interests and goals may select courses that provide emphases  in Cellular and Molecular Biology, Integrative and Systems Biology, or  Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.

Chemistry 351 or  Environmental Studies 235 may substitute for one of the nine biology  courses.
