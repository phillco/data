        "description":"From the creation of the universe out of the remains of defeated gods and goddesses to the placation through sacrifice of those deities, from the nerve gas of the Tokyo subway to burning monks and widows, religion and violence have been intimately related. However, religion has also been a major force in the peace process, building bridges between parties in major political and cultural movements.   The seemingly interminable and intractable religious-ethnic-nationalist conflicts in the world today have contributed to a dramatic reexamination of the role of religion in conflict and peace building as well as the moral norms and normative approaches governing the role of force.  Asia has a long history of dealing with conflict where religion has often been the central issue or a symbol used in the politics surrounding the body, identity, place, and border and ethnic issues.   This course explores the intersection of religion, violence and peace building in Asia in order to examine the role of religion in promoting and preventing conflict.  No longer is religion spoken of in isolation, but is seen as an integral part of discourse that intersects several realms of private to world affairs.  As an interdisciplinary course in the study of religion, it also utilizes the tools of such fields as philosophy, anthropology, sociology, economics, and political science. It is a course that takes theory seriously, yet also emphasizes the importance of applied ethics and lived religion. In this course, we will focus on case studies in Asian contexts, specifically India, Tibet and Southeast Asia, to parse the various intersections of religion, violence and peace building, and to understand more fully how these intersections have been framed in religious discourse; how they have been used to sustain, legitimate, or reject the validity of religious traditions; and how cultural institutions perpetuate the difference between the perception of these interactions.",

Culture will serve as a basis for our analysis of communication both as the force that makes meaningful interaction possible and inhibits it. Students will apply concepts to communication encounters, and conduct research relevant to Asian communication.",

In particular we will study recent attempts to eradicate polio in Pakistan and Nigeria. With the Gates Foundation committing great resources and prestige to the battle against polio, perhaps this viral disease will be no more.  Why do we want to eliminate this disease?  Starting with the 1916 polio epidemic in NYC, we will try to answer: Why did this epidemic impact the rich and affluent but not the poor and slum dwellers? We will read Philip Roths novel Nemesis that tells the story of a polio epidemic in New Jersey during WWII.  Then we will move to San Angelo, TX in the 1950s and follow the viral disease through this community. And, we will study the controversial polio vaccine story and scientific conflicts between vaccine developers Sabin and Salk.  With a vaccine in hand, we return to the initial question: Can polio be eradicated from this planet?  Throughout this course we will learn concepts in virology, epidemiology, and public health.

        "description":"Monsters! Ghosts!  Life-force sucking fiends!  Women who turn into foxes!  Possessed stones falling from the heavens! Supernatural warriors! Magic!  Chinese literature from its inception (at least 3000 years ago) offers a tradition of fantastic beasts, magical occurrences, and horrifying spectacles that has continued into the contemporary.  In this course, we will learn about Chinese literature and other forms of cultural production from their very beginnings, through the lenses of these strange tales.  We will also think more broadly about what constitutes the genres of fantasy and horror, how they might relate to various moments in Chinese history, and why they have remained so appealing through the ages.

Most academic interest in these events is based on understanding the genesis of the storm and how to minimize the damage they cause.  But tornadoes can wreak large economic damage and change the nature of the communities they strike.  This is when the social scientists can offer insight into how society should approach living with tornadoes in an efficient and cost effective manner. This course will examine the policy and social issues surrounding tornadoes.  Issues include the efficacy of tornado warnings, false alarms etc.  Value considerations of mitigation and cost/benefit analysis of various public policies such as mitigation subsidies and the return on investment of Doppler radar.",

        "description":"This is not your typical U.S. literature survey course! The material that you will read in this class will push the geographical and chronological boundaries of the concept of American origins. We will start with literature that pre-dates the arrival of Columbus in the New World by reading a variety of American Indian oral narratives and Viking accounts of first contact with the native peoples of the Americas.  Along with the studying the seventeenth-century Puritan sermons more typically recognized as the origin of American literature and identity, we will also read Spanish and French tales of exploration and captivity that took place throughout the continent before the Pilgrims had even arrived in New England.  And while the eighteenth-century writings of figures such as Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson express specific visions of what it meant to be an American during the Revolution and the era of the New Republic, a variety of African American and American Indian authors from this same time period used literature to offer different perspectives on American identity and history.  By placing these diverse literary texts in conversation with each other, we will find that the United States is not a nation with a single origin story, but rather a nation with multiple origins and a variety of contested stories.",

        "description":"If you are like me, you first encountered poetry in a high school textbook or anthology, or maybe a Hallmark card. Tucked safely away there, poetry seemed nice, but maybe a little boring. But beyond the safety of the familiar anthology, there is an incredible range of exciting and different kinds of poetry being written today. Writers are making poetry out of pure sound and noise, turning their voice into an instrument. They are playing with language the way hip hop and indie music plays with sound and sampling. They are raiding science and psychology to write poems that explore our place in the world. And they are creating poems that blur the lines between poetry, prose, visual art, and video. This course will explore the exciting range of poetry being produced today. We will focus on contemporary poetry, but to provide a background we will also explore some Beat poetry like Allen Ginsberg\u0027s counter-cultural anthem \"Howl,\" poetry from the Black Arts Movement, and poetry from other parts of the world. Along the way, we will explore a wide range of types of poetry: serious poems, sacred poems, and silly poems; sound poems, found poems, investigative poems, hybrid poems, and postmodern poems. We\u0027ll also create -- and perform! -- some poems of our own.",

At the same time, Great Britains rule of India was undergoing a vast conceptual change powered in part by the rise of evangelical Protestantism as a force in British foreign policy.  Whatever else lies in the tangled history of British impact on India and the less often studied Indian impact on Britain, it produced some remarkable literature from many different perspectives.  A topic so vast can only be nibbled at the edges in one semester, but we will approach it through a selection of novels that address issues of personal, cultural, and national identity in very different ways.

        "description":"Art and literature and storytelling are at the epicenter of all that an individual or a nation intends to be. Elizabeth Cook-Lynn     Early nineteenth-century American writers and literary critics hoped to develop a canon of American literature that would distinguish itself from European literary traditions by representing a distinctively American identity and experience. When American literature emerged as its own field of study in the early twentieth century, critics had the same goal but a very different sense of what it meant to be an American, and therefore, what constituted the canon of American literature that would be taught and studied.  Scholars of American literature in the present day, working with developments in feminist criticism and ethnic studies, tend to have an expanded view of what counts as American literature.  In this class we will read literature by both canonical and under-studied authors as a means to address the politics of canon formation in the nineteenth century and into the present day.  Some of the now canonical authors of the nineteenth century, such as Herman Melville and Nathaniel Hawthorne, were not critical or commercial successes in their own time.  And the women writers who were loved by nineteenth-century audiences, such as Harriet Beecher Stowe, E.D.E.N. Southworth, and Elizabeth Stuart Phelps, were relegated to the margins of literary history until recent recovery work by feminist scholars brought some of this literature back into print.  By reading works written by established male writers as well as forgotten and now rediscovered literature by women writers, African American writers, and American Indian writers, we will consider what we gain and lose by developing multiple canons of American literature.",

We will examine literature written both during and after the Greater East Asia War (also known as the Second World War), as well as films and anime produced during the postwar era that deal with the experiences of war victory and defeat, euphoria and disillusionment, nobility and savagery, devastating loss and enduring hope. Our texts will include narratives, poems, plays, and films produced by those who witnessed Japans total war soldiers who served on the battlefield, civilians who maintained the home front, and survivors of attacks by weapons of mass destruction. We will also examine texts produced by the postwar generation whose experience of total war has been filtered by temporal disjuncture and political expediency.  As we read we will consider the evolving attitude of Japanese people toward war and its consequences. We will also examine the manner in which representations of war and its aftermath influence the remembrance of war, and how the remembrance of war in turn affects the debate regarding war responsibility, reparation, national self-defense, and Japans role in the global community whether as trade partner, mentor to developing nations, or willing participant in peace-keeping coalitions.  Our readings will  be primarily in English translation, students of the Japanese language who have completed Japanese 236 or its equivalent will have the opportunity to read some of these works in the original Japanese. In addition to the main texts, critical essays about the authors and works we read, as well as historical texts detailing the wartime and postwar milieus will be assigned to help stimulate our discussions of the literary and extra-literary concerns that have combined to produce the works we read.",

Throughout, proofs and proof  techniques will play a prominent role. Also,  considerable attention will be given to  constructions with the classical tools,  constructions with other tools sets, and more generally to the important history of the famous  construction problems of antiquity.  Various  drawing schemes (3-dvisualization) will be  included, along with the associated impact on the discovery of non-euclidean systems. Attention to  Hilbert\u0027s axioms for Euclidean Geometry and subsequent work on the subject is a likely  component, as is attention to higher dimensional Euclidean spaces.

We see ads for them on TV, we debate whether or not they make more money than the movie industry\u0026and we agonize over whether they cause violence in our children. Games are now a major cultural force. The time is ripe for us to dig deeper into the many questions that games raise.  A Theory of Fun, Raph Koster.  When most people think of games, they think of light, fun, and diverting cultural forms without much impact on serious society. But games are as old as humanity, and their place in the social fabric has emerged out of their location at the intersection between interactivity, improvisation, strategy, systematic thinking, and style.  In this course, we will explore the nature of games in contemporary American culture.  What makes games different from other cultural forms?  What makes them similar?  What is the relationship between games and stories?  What is the role of interactivity in games?  What directions and forms will games take in the future?  We will consider these questions and more, and we will do so both by reading and discussing theories of gaming as well as playing, designing, and creating games ourselves.",

We will examine the nature of that antagonism and even embrace it at times, seeking out new, more productive ways to conceive of popular music in film. Some questions guiding the course include: How does popular music work in film? How do we define popular music? How have such definitions shifted throughout time and within global networks? Is the crucial popular music concept of authenticity compromised or enhanced in film? How does popular music change the film soundtrack? Does music video count as film? How has film influenced the development of popular music?",

But even if these fanciful possibilities are set aside, deep questions about the nature and extent of our knowledge of the world remain:  Must you know that you know in order to know, or is merely having your belief produced in the right way sufficient?   Does knowledge require secure foundational beliefs (as Descartes claimed), or can the connections forged between beliefs in a large enough belief-web provide it?  Where do scientific accounts of human learning and cognition fit into this?  More generally, how should we regard scientific knowledge claims?  Since history is littered with the corpses of past scientific theories, caution about contemporary ones seems called for.  But how cautious should we be?  Should we view the current accounts as more or less accurate descriptions of reality, or should we understand them in some other way, perhaps as mere instruments or tools for generating and predicting certain sorts of experiences?

The seemingly interminable and intractable religious-ethnic-nationalist conflicts in the world today have contributed to a dramatic reexamination of the role of religion in conflict and peace building as well as the moral norms and normative approaches governing the role of force.  Asia has a long history of dealing with conflict where religion has often been the central issue or a symbol used in the politics surrounding the body, identity, place, and border and ethnic issues.   This course explores the intersection of religion, violence and peace building in Asia in order to examine the role of religion in promoting and preventing conflict.  No longer is religion spoken of in isolation, but is seen as an integral part of discourse that intersects several realms of private to world affairs.  As an interdisciplinary course in the study of religion, it also utilizes the tools of such fields as philosophy, anthropology, sociology, economics, and political science. It is a course that takes theory seriously, yet also emphasizes the importance of applied ethics and lived religion. In this course, we will focus on case studies in Asian contexts, specifically India, Tibet and Southeast Asia, to parse the various intersections of religion, violence and peace building, and to understand more fully how these intersections have been framed in religious discourse; how they have been used to sustain, legitimate, or reject the validity of religious traditions; and how cultural institutions perpetuate the difference between the perception of these interactions.",

For many people, organized religion provides a major source of insight for addressing these questions and others like them (such as monogamy, porn, etc.); while many other people find religion un-helpful in this regard. This course will consider how sex functions in religious ways in contemporary society: how it offers values, understandings of reality, ways of relating to one another and oneself, ways of ordering ones bodily existence and other things that religions do. And we will critically analyze how religious communities themselves address sexual matters such as marriage, what counts as good sex, and homosexuality. We will see that sexual matters, far from being either insignificant or purely private, involve weighty issues of intimacy, power, selfhood, ethics, politics, economics.... Through this kind of multi-faceted study, we will try to understand, in new ways, the promiscuous relationships that religion and sex have with one another.",

This course explores why we hear things like this constantly in contemporary culture and society. By looking at both pop culture (movies, memoirs, TV) and everyday practices like Facebook and dieting, we will explore various ways people are lead to pursue, shape, realize, manage, and otherwise relate to their selves. We will map some of the forces all around us advertising, pop culture, college education (!), medicine, to name but a few  that try to seduce us into becoming particular kinds of selves, even as we are told that ones self (or identity) is something authentic and unique to each of us, to be discovered deep within. In addition to pop culture and everyday practices, we will read a number of key theorists whose models of selfhood have had wide impact in society and in various academic disciplines. We will see how shaping ones self is a religious matter, if we allow religious to mean more than just organized religion.",

        "description":"Over the past twenty or so years, the body has emerged as a vital site of social, ritual and feminist analyses as scholars from various disciplines have explored how such a lens is socially meaningful from it natural to its denatured sense to the notion of a body politic and as an institutional force.  With the importance of both practices of asceticism and eroticism as well as the complexities surrounding gender and perfection, the body plays a vital role in the religions of Asia.  This course will examine the interrelationship of the body and power by exploring how the body creates parameters of religiousness or perfection (like a Buddha, god or guru); and how its presence, discipline or indulgence serves as a mark of a religious community or eligibility for liberation or of the sacred in Hindu, Buddhist and local traditions of Asia. A certain amount of emphasis will be placed on wider comparative and theoretical approaches to the study of the body and power in history, drawing on the disciplines of religious studies, sociology, gender studies, ritual studies, cultural studies, and medicine as well as gaining a familiarity with Indian, Chinese and Tibetan religious texts in translation. Students will examine literal and metaphorical uses of the body in terms of literary and institutional interpretations.  The course will place views and practices of the body against particular historical and cultural backdrops ranging in time from the ancient to the modern periods.",

To accomplish this comparison, we will examine the preconditions of movement activism; the life cycle of activists; the importance of incentive structures and the free rider problem in membership mobilization; social control in social movement organizations and industries; the professional organizer versus political process model of movement dynamics; and identity politics.  We will also discuss the paradox of movement success and failure; the social functions of movement defeat; the role of movement intellectuals and ideology; the importance of social movement litigation; movement competition and cooperation; the crucial component of political opportunity structures; social movement life cycles; proto-social movements and self-help; determinants of leftist radicalism and political socialization; counter-movement dynamics; social movement trajectories; and the importance of transcendent or religious motivation.

Comenzamos con la guerra entre los Estados Unidos y Mxico que culmin con la creacin de la mayor parte de la frontera actual entre estos dos pases.  Contemplamos el significado de la frontera poltica tanto como la cultural y ling\nstica, y las maneras en que se evoca en la narrativa, arte, msica,  y pelculas que forman los textos del curso.  Adems, cuestionamos el concepto de la frontera como rgido y/o elstico, como reliquia del pasado y/o espacio que seala un futuro globalizado. Plantearemos, entre otras, las siguientes preguntas:  Cmo se construye la identidad mediante las diferencias?  Es til la frontera como metfora para un encuentro entre personas de diferente raza, clase, genro, orientacin sexual, religin, edad, etc.?  Qu limitaciones tiene esta metfora?  Hasta donde se extiende la frontera cultural?  Qu implica el acto de cruzar una frontera? Existe una cultura fronteriza?  Qu contribuyen el feminismo, pluralismo, y posmodernismo al concepto de la frontera?

To help achieve this challenging goal, students will work on two different, interrelated levels. On one level, they will learn the techniques and practices of magicians and performing artists, such as voice and breathing, sleight-of-hand, mechanical techniques, theatrical blocking, misdirection, audience management, character development, and scriptwriting. But these embodied practices will gain their purpose and direction by our studying the theoretical ideas, teachings, and writings of great magicians, such as Eugene Burger, Juan Tamariz, Dai Vernon, and Tommy Wonder.  By the end of the semester every student will have developed a deep understanding of the magical arts and composed a five-to-seven minute magic act.  As a culminating experience, students will perform their acts for a jury of magicians, who will give feedback for their further development.",

In this course, we will explore a variety of techniques for physical and emotional release developed by contemporary practitioners.  We will also explore methods for understanding and releasing the meaning and emotion embedded in dramatic texts, with special attention to the heightened language of classical drama and the complications of speaking verse.",
