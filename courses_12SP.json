Specifically, it is designed to give students a firm grasp on central questions in linguistic anthropology as well as a more general critical approach to language across human cultures and social contexts. At the end of this course, students will have earned a sophisticated approach to questions of interpersonal and cross-cultural communication, discourse, narrative, language ideologies, intertextuality, and a host of other topics related to the sociocultural study of language. In turn, they will have learned to apply a cross-cultural socio-linguistic analysis to myriad everyday settings in which speech and texts are primary modes of social interaction.",

British artists strove to break the bonds of tradition and academic correctness in styles that sprang from their individuality and incorporated non-Western sources. Many of these creators sought to liberate art from the obligation to moralize or serve an institution so that it might rather follow the imperative to be beautiful, after the creed, \"art for art\u0027s sake.\" The creation of beauty in homes of integrated furnishings and architecture, which blurred the distinctions between fine and decorative art, reflected designers\u0027 aims to make art part of the common person\u0027s daily life, rather than a thing effectively confined to galleries, museums and the homes of the wealthy. The course examines a fascinating array of painters, sculptors, architects, designers and illustrators from movements including the Pre-Raphaelites, Aestheticism, Arts \u0026 Crafts, Queen Anne, Symbolism, the New Sculpture, Tonalism, and Art Nouveau.",

        "description":"Have you ever thought about what happens next?  Is this life the only one? If there is another life, how will it take shape?  Do you have control over your fate or even death? Is a Buddha dead or alive?  Why were there 14 Dalai Lamas?  Peter Berger, a sociologist who has written on religion, says: \"Witnessing the death of others.and anticipating his own death, the individual is strongly propelled to question the ad hoc cognitive and normative operating procedure of his \u0027normal\u0027 life in society. Death presents society with a formidable problem not only because of its obvious threat to the continuity of human relationships, but because it threatens the basic assumptions of order on which society rests.\"  On another note, Sogyal Rinpoche\u0027s Tibetan Book of Living and Dying on the other hand compels its readers to think about how much agency we have, in other words,that if we cultivate an awareness of death, we can control much more than we think.  On a different note, Stephen Teiser\u0027s work on the ghost festival in medieval China reflects concerns about ancestor worship, filial obligation, and generosity within three different traditions. This course explores the theme of death journeys and the afterlife in the East Asian religions of China, Tibet, Japan in order to reveal the complexity and diversity of the influences on understandings onf life and death and karmic journeys.  In exploring the nature of religion in Asia within specific literary and visual representations, students will be exposed to the complex web of social-political worlds, the causes and effects of individual and collective actions, andor the desperate need to understand suffering all being mapped out as a journey in the afterlife or a stage within that journey.  One of the underlying questions this course will consider is: Does religion gives meaning to our experiences?  In other words, does it shape our perspectives on how we view our lives and what will happen afterwards in death or the after-death state?  How does religion make sense of dDeath?  What do cyclical views of death journeys tell us about a culture? If rebirth does occur, how has it been represented in human form and images? Students address such questions as reflected in poetry, stories, philosophical treatises, landscape paintings, and mandalas (representations of the universe in Buddhist art), and ritual practice..  In this course, we will consider issues of awareness of death in life, deathbed rituals, relic veneration, abortion, suicide, and the blurring of dimensions in reincarnation (avatar, tulku, ghosts, hell beings, nature spirits). The course will also consider contemporary scientific studies as the Reincarnation Research Center in Virginia and studies on meditation in order to reflect on scientific approaches to religionus worldviews and the intersection of religion and medicine.  This course will collaborate with the Crow Collection of Asian Art and the Dallas Museum of Art through site visits.",

When viewing primary sources of business and economics research, students usually are exposed only to the end product of the research effort; the published material after it has been sanitized, reviewed, and edited. However, conducting research is rarely so straightforward and is better thought of as a process of fits and starts. Critical to the research effort process is its foundation: the identification of an interesting research question that contributes to the literature; understanding what others have done in attempting to answer similar questions in the related literature; and what tools and methodologies are ultimately available to conduct the applied research effort. We will view research from the ground-up, learning from what previous students and Austin College faculty have done in their own research efforts. The course will allow students to observe and participate in the process of doing research. With this knowledge base in-hand, students will detail and produce a foundation for their own research effort toward answering a question of interest. While this course will not require students to complete a full research study (data collection and analysis, etc.), the goal is to build the proper foundation for identifying appropriate research questions, developing relevant theory, and designing applied research methodology for future endeavors.

We will move through the major upheavals of the twentieth century (the May Fourth movement, the Communist take-over, the Cultural Revolution, the democracy movements of 1989, and Open Market Reform and its continuing effects), using literature as a guide to how these sweeping social changes impacted those living through them and altered the very fabric of culture.

When viewing primary sources of business and economics research, students usually are exposed only to the end product of the research effort; the published material after it has been sanitized, reviewed, and edited. However, conducting research is rarely so straightforward and is better thought of as a process of fits and starts. Critical to the research effort process is its foundation: the identification of an interesting research question that contributes to the literature; understanding what others have done in attempting to answer similar questions in the related literature; and what tools and methodologies are ultimately available to conduct the applied research effort. We will view research from the ground-up, learning from what previous students and Austin College faculty have done in their own research efforts. The course will allow students to observe and participate in the process of doing research. With this knowledge base in-hand, students will detail and produce a foundation for their own research effort toward answering a question of interest. While this course will not require students to complete a full research study (data collection and analysis, etc.), the goal is to build the proper foundation for identifying appropriate research questions, developing relevant theory, and designing applied research methodology for future endeavors.

Nineteenth-century American authors saw themselves charged with creating a distinctively \"American\" literature as a means to assist the development of a national culture and identity. We will read a variety works by contemporary authors that affirm, contest, and speak back to the artistic and ideological concerns of nineteenth-century literature, especially in relation to issues of race, gender, ethnicity, and class. Familiar works by Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allen Poe, Washington Irving, Louisa May Alcott, Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, and Mark Twain will be defamiliarized by reading responses to that literature by contemporary authors such as Geraldine Brooks, Angela Carter, John Updike, Toni Morrison, Bharati Mukherjee, Louise Erdrich, and Susan Howe. Placing nineteenth-century and present day authors in conversation with each other will provide an opportunity to evaluate the earlier literature\u0027s currency and continued relevancy in the shaping of contemporary literature. While we may find that contemporary authors have a different vision for the United States than their counterparts from the 1800s, the main idea behind this course is that studying a variety of current adaptations will help us better appreciate and understand nineteenth-century American literature.",

Long underappreciated as literary genre, science fiction has now come into its own as both popular fiction and object of study-none of which changes the fact that most people who consume it voraciously just think it\u0027s cool.  Channeling that fiercely loyal, even secessionist impulse, we will analyze how science fiction creates a sense of wonder at the workings of alternative worlds, utopian and dystopian, human and alien, physically and temporally distant.  Our focus will be twentieth-century English-language SF that takes for its subject matter issues such as humans\u0027 relationships to technology, the environment, alien races, and each other; travel through time and space at or faster than light speed; exploration and colonization of new planets, galaxies, and states of being; and the quintessentially human concerns of race, class, and gender.",

My class will read a series of illness narratives (\"pathographies\") and examine ways that the medical world treats patients and how patients respond to that treatment in literature. Literary works discussed will include Albom\u0027s Tuesdays with Morrie (ALS), Fadiman\u0027s The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down, (epilepsy in Hmong vs. American society), Pomerance\u0027s The Elephant Man (a nineteenth-century genetic mystery), Dr. Baxter\u0027s The Least of These My Brethren (AIDS), and Edson\u0027s Wit (ovarian cancer).  Atleast twice during the term, Professors Platizky and Redshaw will link their classes based on films, plays, and other ancillary materials that treat genetics and epidemiology in scientific as well as literary ways.  Common texts and films may include: Tuesdays with Morrie and And the Band Played On.  Concerns addressed in this class will also, to varying degrees, include the following: whether the study of literature can make medical personnel more empathetic; differences between the medical treatment of men and women; Western and non-Western medicine; ways that the language of literature and medicine matter both for their similarities and differences. When possible, course discussions will also be supplemented by occasional visits from other teachers, alums, or guest visitors in the sciences, social sciences, and humanities.",

All kinds of fun stuff. At the forefront of these changes were a wide range of avant-garde and innovative artists and writers who saw themselves as a new vanguard of American culture. These modernists understood themselves as writing a genuinely NEW literature that sought to adequately reflect - and direct - the new social realities of the 20th century. This course aims to explore this new and exciting literature by writers like Ezra Pound, Gertrude Stein, William Carlos Williams, Jean Toomer, and Marianne Moore. These writers challenged literature conventions and wrote in radically new ways. Because their innovations often took place in conversation with the visual arts -- movements like Cubism, Futurism, and Dada -- the course will be linked with ARTH 343: Modern Art and Architecture. This means that some of our class sessions will meet with ARTH 343, giving us an opportunity to explore the links between visual art and writing.",

Springing from the victorious anti-colonial liberation struggles of the mid-twentieth century, and developing as the intellectual heir to those struggles, postcolonial critique sets out in opposition to the multiple forms that oppression may still take today in the previously colonized countries, where power relations remain intricately shaped and distorted by centuries of colonial dominance.  Recognizing that purely political measures like the granting of formal independence to previously colonized societies have by no means necessarily led to freedom from oppression and exploitation, postcolonial critics as cultural critics are committed to forms of analysis that have the potential to lead to the attainment of a greater freedom for all.  (And \"all\" here means all, not just the people of the (so-called: the term is obsolete) Third World, the three-quarters of the world\u0027s population [Ashcroft et al., The Empire Writes Back] who have over the past seventy-odd years emerged from direct colonial rule.) Possible texts are Ania Loomba, Colonialism/Postcolonialism; Frantz Fanon, The Wretched of the Earth; Emily Bront�, Wuthering Heights; V.S.Naipaul, Guerrillas; Daniel Defoe, Robinson Crusoe; J.M. Coetzee, Foe; Arvind Adiga, The White Tiger.",

        "description":"Through archival recovery efforts, feminist and ethnic studies scholars in the past two decades have radically altered the canon of American literature that has been traditionally taught and studied.  By returning to the archives of American literature, they have rediscovered the lost voices and stories of dozens of forgotten minority and women writers.  As a result, slave narratives, captivity narratives, sentimental novels, American Indian literature, and women\u0027s diaries are now regularly incorporated into the study of pre-1900 American literature and culture.  We will read several of these formerly \"lost\" texts, discuss the process of their recovery, examine the literary traditions to which they are responding and contributing, and interpret these texts literature within their own historical and cultural moments.  But there are still more stories out there waiting to be re-discovered and recovered.  For this reason, we will engage in our own archival research-primarily through digital archives, but also through class visits to local archives.  Each of us will develop our own archival recovery project in order to bring to voice another lost writer or forgotten story.  Throughout the semester we will read literary and cultural theory that will address the politics of whose stories get told and for what reasons and that will complicate the sometimes arbitrary distinctions we make between \"high\" and \"low\" literary culture.

Students will read sociological and pedagogical studies on this topic and examine the role of \u0027the foreigner\u0027 and \u0027the foreign\u0027 in German culture. There will be a strong emphasis on understanding racial, ethnic, religious, gender, and sexual orientation and other types of diversity.  Among the sources we will study are the pamphlet writing \"Der Juden Spiegel\"  of 1507 by Johannes Pfefferkorn, Theodor Storm\u0027s \"Immensee\" of 1849, as well as stories from the national socialist children\u0027s book \"The Poisonous Mushroom\" of 1938. We will discuss and analyze various films, among them the infamous anti-Semitic movie \"Jud S\n�\" of 1940, as well as movies that look back to the national socialist past of Germany, such as \"Aim�e and Jaguar\" (1999) and \"Rosenstrasse\" (2003), and to the roots of national socialist ideology, such as \"Das Weisse Band\" (2009). Furthermore, we will watch and discuss movies that depict more current aspects of the \"foreigner\" in Germany, such as Rainer Werner Fassbinder\u0027s film \"Angst essen Seele auf\" (1974). In this context we will also look at the image of the foreigner as depicted in German hit songs in the second half of the 20th century and examine in which ways both genres approach the Gastarbeiterproblem in Germany.  Finally, we will explore through text and film in which way immigration has affected German society in recent decades and whether it has led to a change in the image and status of the foreigner in Germany.",

Why are there so many more songs about women chasing after a guy than running the world? Why is there no lead character on any current TV series who is homeless, and almost none who are unemployed? And most importantly: what kind of people do we become when this is the kind of world that our media offer us? In this course we explore how different kinds of media (books, magazines, music, TV, films social networks) shape not only how we imagine race, gender and class, but how we experience them in our everyday lives. Students will be expected not merely to be passive consumers of various media for this course, but active interpreters, tracing the effects media have on race, gender, and class.",

While calls for visual literacy have begun the crucial project of lessening the dominance of the written text, our sonic world remains largely unexamined. This course provides an introduction to the burgeoning field of sound studies. The main goal is to open up our ears to the different soundscapes throughout history and across geographies. Some of the aspects of sound studies that we will focus on include the transformation of modern psychoacoustics via recorded sound, the presence of the aural past in written and visual texts, the history of listening, the use of sound as a mechanism of control, the hierarchy of the senses, the soundscapes of mass culture, etc. Given that sound studies is an interdisciplinary field of inquiry, the course will necessarily survey a wide range of media: film, popular music, television, radio, digital culture, etc. ",

Shopping is a national pastime, and - if bumper stickers are to be believed - he who dies with the most \"toys\" wins.  True, this takes a large toll on the environment.  But should we care?  As long as we have the money, what could be wrong with spending it however we want and living in whatever fashion we please?   This course will consider a variety of answers to these questions by looking carefully and systematically at how different moral theories would address them.  Along the way, we will explore whether our only obligations are to people or whether nonhuman animals and even plants deserve direct moral consideration.  In addition to studying what the different moral theories generally require of us, we also will practice applying the theories to a variety of case studies that involve environmental problems of one sort or another. No previous background in philosophy is needed.  ",

        "description":"The term \u0027existentialism\u0027 comprises a loose collection of intellectuals and artists usually associated with such themes as nihilism, angst, radical \"situated\" choice, responsibility and authenticity. As a movement, existentialism had its biggest influence in Europe and the Americas from the late 1940\u0027s to the 1970\u0027s.  But its roots go back at least to Kierkegaard, Dostoievsky and Nietzsche in the 19th century, and to Heidegger, Sartre, Beauvoir and Camus from the 1920\u0027s through the 1940\u0027s.  This course will introduce students to \"classic\" philosophical texts of existentialism (Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Sartre and Beauvoir) as well as some of their various internal and external critics up to the present (e.g., Merleau-Ponty, Levinas, Fanon, Althusser,Foucault, Derrida, LeDoeuff).  In this way, this course makes a nice introduction to recent work in continental philosophy.  This is a course only for those students who love to read and discuss lots of difficult texts and then write about them carefully. (1/2 W credit)",

A more traditional view presents the citizen as a person who is entitled to certain rights and protections in return for a minimal commitment to the political system and process. More recent scholarship expands the discussion to conceptualize citizenship as involving broader engagement in the political process and in the community. In this view, labeled by Craig Rimmerman as \"the New Citizenship,\" the ideal citizen is a person who not only votes but who also contributes to the community through service and activism. In this course we will investigate these different notions of citizenship starting with a discussion of the more traditional view and then moving into a discussion of the motivations for, barriers to, and implications of active citizenship. Readings, lectures, and class discussions will cover topics ranging from the benefits of community engagement as presented by Robert Putnam, case studies of service and activism, and the role of non-profit organizations and public-private partnerships in addressing and forming policy responses to complex social and economic issues.",

The emphasis is on the psychological principles and how they apply in a work context. Topics will include legal issues in employment, selection of employees, job analysis, performance appraisal, training, leadership, motivation, and group behavior. Industrial/Organizational (I/O) psychology involves the application of psychological principles to the work context. A major emphasis of this course will be the real-world application of this body of knowledge to workplace issues and the demonstration of the value of applying I/O principles to an organization. Secondary objectives of this class are to illustrate how the principles of Industrial/Organizational Psychology can be applied to day-to-day experiences as a member of an organization and to help students develop as effective organizational members or leaders.

Instead of making the mastery of anatomical details the main goal and then searching for applications of this knowledge, actual clinical cases will be used as both a teaching instrument and motivating force to encourage each student to delve into further study of normal anatomy and function. We will begin with a rapid review of Human Neuroanatomy following by learning to read and write clinical case presentations and what components are a part of the standard neurological examination. The remaining portion of the semester will be devoted to working with individual case studies in neurology and psychology and using these cases for the formation of hypotheses concerning the location and nature of patient\u0027s problems. Special attention will be devoted to new treatments thanks to recent advances in neuroscience in a wide variety of clinical populations. Behavioral and brain alterations due to stroke, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, or degenerative diseases will be at the core of many of the clinical cases that we will examine during the semester. This course will require substantial time outside of class to review appropriate materials concerning each case covered.",

We will analyze the confluence of science and biblical interpretation in the industrial revolution, focusing in particular on 19th century developments in physics, biology, psychiatry, and archaeology, in combination with the evolution of new forms of media and an increasing emphasis on philology, so as to understand more fully the manner in which biblical interpretation came to be understood as a \"science\" proper and how, in turn, such views of the bible also shaped scientific method itself.  We will also pay attention to how specific aspects of scientific theory affected the development of the science of biblical study. The course will end with a thorough examination of the 1893 heresy trial of Charles Augustus Briggs and the resultant split in the Presbyterian Church. The latter represents something of an irony in how the \"science\" of biblical interpretations falls back on itself in the fundamentalist-modernist controversy, in which science now becomes the enemy of biblical interpretation.

        "description":"Asia\u0027s rapid economic development and efforts to modernize have often resulted in both positive and negative effects on natural and cultural environments.  Several examples come to mind. In the case of China, the building of the Three Gorges Dam and the Qinghai-Tibet railway resulted in the (re)settlement (and to some, dislocation) of whole communities.  Depending on the perspective, such movements have led to higher educational and/or economic benefits or the destruction of an indigenous culture\u0027s vital religious traditions.  Legacies of what some have called \"3000 years of unsustainable growth\" and \"Mao\u0027s war on nature\" have been exacerbated by rapid economic development, pollution, and inequality. Commodification and commercialization of minority cultures are often the last gleams of hope in order to preserve religious traditions in this era of competition. With its history of dramatic policy swings and cycles of repression and accommodation, China\u0027s social and environmental future remain unclear. However, China is not an isolated case.  India, Mongolia and several areas in Southeast Asia have a history of responses to the environment. One person\u0027s preservation and progress are another\u0027s degradation.  However, one thing is clear, the environment is used as a signifier.  For example, Mongolian shamans\u0027 knowledge of ethnobotany; Tibetan Buddhists\u0027 rituals to the spirits of the land, tree and water; Thai tree hugging; Asian medicine\u0027s plant, mineral and animal \"energies\";  and Southeast Asia\u0027s eco-Buddhist movements all reflect a long standing concern for natural resources, for cultural preservation and for overall well-being.  This course will address how religious traditions in Asia (specifically in India, China and Southeast Asia) are intertwined with the environment.   In addition to addressing many factors which have contributed to the contemporary environmental situation, and responses to these problems from both the state and growing environmental movements, we will also address Asian religious traditions\u0027 use of the environment in rituals, medicine, philosophy, and as a marker of cultural identity as well as the extent to which particular \"cultures\" of nature can be identified.  We will ask among other questions: To what extent can we define a view of \"nature\" that is characteristic of Asian culture, particularly as it relates to religious worldviews? What is the relationship between cultural perceptions of nature, and actual behavior? How useful is it to think about \"religion\" in analyses of environmental transformation? In addition, we explore regulatory and environmental policies and their impact on Buddhist, Daoist, Hindu, and local traditions.  The class will closely scrutinize the relationship between politics, power, and the environment and how these are often illustrated in maps, stories, and historical and political accounts.",

Historically, the Seder has been a site of connection as well as conflict for multiple religious and cultural traditions. In this course we will address questions such as: What does it mean for memory to be mandated? What is the function of ritual In shaping religious narratives? What happens when a diverse community seeks to authentically embrace a ritual from a tradition that might not be its own? In this project-based course, students will be expected to actively engage in critical reflection, textual analysis, and the creative and collaborative making of an Austin College Seder.",

        "description":"Have you ever thought about what happens next?  Is this life the only one? If there is another life, how will it take shape?  Do you have control over your fate or even death? Is a Buddha dead or alive?  Why were there 14 Dalai Lamas?  Peter Berger, a sociologist who has written on religion, says: \"Witnessing the death of others.and anticipating his own death, the individual is strongly propelled to question the ad hoc cognitive and normative operating procedure of his \u0027normal\u0027 life in society. Death presents society with a formidable problem not only because of its obvious threat to the continuity of human relationships, but because it threatens the basic assumptions of order on which society rests.\"  Sogyal Rinpoche\u0027s Tibetan Book of Living and Dying on the other hand compels its readers to think about how much agency we have, in other words, we cultivate an awareness of death, we can control much more than we think.  On a different note, Stephen Teiser\u0027s work on the ghost festival in medieval China reflects concerns about ancestor worship, filial obligation, and generosity within three different traditions. This course explores the theme of death journeys and the afterlife in East Asian religions  in order to reveal the complexity and diversity of understandings on death and karmic journeys.  In exploring the nature of religion in Asia within specific literary and visual representations, students will be exposed to the complex web of social-political worlds, the causes and effects of individual and collective actions, and the desperate need to understand suffering all being mapped out as a journey in the afterlife or a stage within that journey.  One of the underlying questions this course will consider is: Does religion gives meaning to our experiences?  In other words, does it shape our perspectives on how we view our lives and what will happen afterwards in death or the after-death state?  How does religion make sense of death?  What do cyclical views of death journeys tell us about a culture? If rebirth does occur, how has it been represented in human form and images? Students address such questions as reflected in poetry, stories, philosophical treatises, landscape paintings, mandalas (representations of the universe in Buddhist art), and ritual practice.  In this course, we will consider issues of awareness of death in life, deathbed rituals, relic veneration, abortion, suicide, and the blurring of dimensions in reincarnation (avatar, tulku, ghosts, hell beings, nature spirits). The course will also consider contemporary scientific studies as the Reincarnation Research Center in Virginia and studies on meditation in order to reflect on scientific approaches to religion and the intersection of religion and medicine.  This course will collaborate with the Crow Collection of Asian Art and the Dallas Museum of Art through site visits.",

Approximately $4 billion is spent annually on nanotechnology research leading to discoveries that are beginning to produce tangible applications that directly impact our lives.  In the meantime, the media has reported on the potential of nanotechnology emphasizing the exciting and spectacular science while minimizing the risks associated with the new science.  The entertainment industry has manipulated the risks to create horror scenarios fueling popular movies, TV series and video games.  This course will explore the potential economic, environmental, social, and ethical implications of the broad field of nanotechnology by examining these and other questions.    Is nanotechnology different than other scientific fields? What are the general risks of nanotechnology? Can and/or should the government regulate nanotechnology?    We will be studying the ethical and social implications of nanotechnology, not specific scientific advances; therefore, science experience is not necessary or expected.",

We will also consider the varying chords of Southern music; historical and cultural roots of NASCAR; lynching, sexualized violence and the limitations of Southern justice; the grip of Southern humor; the Communist party in the South; the uniqueness of Southern religion; the critical importance of the \"outside agitator,\" the convict lease system and penal reform; the South in movies and on television; unusual health issues (e.g., pellagra, hookworm and \"clay-eating\"); Southern accents and forms of deference; the potential rise of a \"Neo-Confederate\" movement; and others.
